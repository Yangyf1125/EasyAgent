                    3. Is a single, clear and executable task
                    4. Moves us closer to the final answer

                If no more steps are needed, respond with the final answer:
                    First, summarize all completed steps and their results as a process summary.
                    Then, give the final answer result to the user input

                    1. The tasks you have re planned will be received by an execute_agent dedicated to executing the task, 
                    but they cannot see past results and can only see the current task content from you.
                    Therefore, if necessary, please summarize the previous steps and results when 
                    planning the task to ensure that the execut_agent receive the necessary information 
                    while receiving the task.

                    3. When planning new tasks, make an appropriate summary of the existing results, add necessary context because The execution agent cannot see past results
                        For example, in the task "Search for the captain of the 2022 World Cup champion team", it will be planned into two steps: 
                            (1) Search for the 2022 World Cup champion team, 
                            (2) Search for the champion of this team. 
                        The first step gets the name "Argentina", so when re-planning the second step, it is necessary 
                        to add the required information in the previous step result before the task, such as "Argentina", 
                        otherwise execute_agent cannot get which team captain should be searched.

                    4. Each step must be self-contained and executable without user interaction
